v0.24
	Added support for creating subdirectories in the output
	file naming algorithm.  It is now possible to include a 
	backslash ('\') character in the filename macro, which will
	cause a subdirectory to be formed.
        
        Updated to Lame 3.93.1
        
        Fixed bug displaying ampersand (&) in track window

v0.23:
	Updated vorb_enc.dll to v1.0 release of Ogg Vorbis.

	Added UTF-8 support to Ogg Vorbis comment tags.

	New "Netscape-style" preferences dialog, with TreeView control on
	left.

	Fixed DGENRE bug for Freedb level 5.
	
	Updated makefiles and source for gcc-2.95.3.

v0.22:
	Updated Ogg Vorbis version to use the 1.0rc3 release.

	Now prompts before overwriting files that already exist.

	Now uses large buffers up to the size of available physical
	memory when ripping.

	Support for Freedb protocol level 5 (DGENRE and DYEAR)
	lines in the cddb entry.

	Added normalization of ripped tracks.  The tracks are
	first scanned and then during the rip, the normalization
	is applied directly.  Between 10%-100% (configurable)
	of the audio track is scanned and analyzed to find the
	peak level.

	Added HTTP proxy authentication

	No longer truncates album title and artist name to 30
	characters (relic from old ID3 code).

	Added option to abort ripping at end of current track in
	rip dialog.

v0.21:
	Switched to new Help format (MS HTML Help).

	Fixed M3U file generation if invalid characters present in the
	filename.

	Numerous fixes to freedb submission.  Completely dropped all
	mentions of cddb.cddb.com.  
  
	Now accepts up to 32 inexact matches from freedb.

v0.20:
	Includes track number in ID3v1 tag.

	Can now set submit CGI script.

	Changed to a smaller font in the options property sheet dialogs.
	
v0.19:
	Added new modes for Ogg Vorbis encoding (from the libvorbis beta 2
	release).
	
	Tuned the buffer allocation sizes for ripping WAV and RAW.

	Data tracks can no longer be checked.

	Fixed bug in akrip32.dll in the code that generates the index
	for CDPLAYER.INI for CD's with data at the end.  It would greatly
	help if MS would actually document the algorithm, instead of making
	us guess (or reverse engineer).

	Fixed bug in the Rip Segment dialog that kept the tic mark for the
	beginning of the last track from being added.

	Added menu option to write current CD info to CDPLAYER.INI

	HTTP proxy port now defaults to port 80.
	
v0.18a:
	Sheesh.  Left in a duplicate call to xtOpenOutput(), which slowed
	things down and confused the WAV header generation.
	
v0.18:
	Added a generalized encoder interface DLL, xtenc.dll, to make
	including new encoder DLLs a simpler process.  Currently supported
	encoders are raw data (no encoder), WAV, lame_enc.dll, blade_enc.dll
	and vorb_enc.dll.  ID3 tagging, VBR headers, etc. are handled
	automatically by xtenc.dll.

	Wrote a BladeEnc-style DLL wrapper for the Ogg Vorbis encoder.
	vorbis_dll.c must be linked against libvorbisfile.a vorbisfile.a,
	available at http://www.xiph.org.

	Converted all of the .jpg files in the help documentation to .png.
	
v0.17:
	Now actually writes VBR header when option is selected for lame_enc

	Added option to make rip and encode threads "nice".  This will mainly
	help cancelling rip/encode under NT (not that I'm saying NT's 
	scheduler is brain-dead).

	Merged changes from multiple people to get compilation under
	MSVC to work
	
v0.16:
	Toolbar automatically redraws itself when switching to/from hi-color
	buttons.

	CDDB default servers updated to cddb.cddb.com and freedb.freedb.org.

	No longer displays "Track 0" when started up with no CD present.

v0.15:
	Added "flat" style to toolbar, plus the ability to switch between
	16-color and 24-bit bitmaps on the toolbar.

	Automatically detects 16-bpp color display or better, and uses the
	hicolor bitmaps.
	
v0.14.1:
	Rereleased source archive for v0.14, making sure that all binary
	files (*.ico,*.bmp,*.jpg) were marked as binary in CVS.

v0.14:
	Merged in changes from Blair Thompson -- time remaining indicator
	on rip dialog, use of CDPLAYER.INI (in akrip32.dll) when CDDB not
	available.

	Improved NT/2000 support in akrip32.dll.  Synched dll source code
	with v0.94.
	
v0.13:
	Added "rip segment" functionality, including a nifty custom 
	dual-slider range selection control.  Clicking to the left or
	right of either slider causes the slider to "snap" to the start/end
	of the next/previous track.  Can also be used to rip multiple tracks
	as one (or the whole CD for that matter).
	
	Enabled the CDDB get site list functionality in the CDDB options
	dialog.

	Fixed the focus error for the album and artist title never giving
	up focus (or rather the other components not taking it).

v0.12:
	Added basic support for LAME_ENC.DLL.
	
	Improved response time for hitting "Cancel" during rip operations
	on slower CPUs.
	
v0.11:
        Added CDDB support.  If enabled, when the refresh button is pushed,
	a thread is started to run the CDDB query.  If the CDDB query returns
	multiple matches, the program reacts according to what it is doing.
	If in the middle of ripping a track, it simply uses the first match.
	If it is not, it pops up a dialog box, and requests that the user
	select one of the inexact matches.
	
	Changed read loop to always read maxRip frames, and then to truncate
	the last frame if necessary.  The CDR_READ10_2 function seemed to
	have problems on certain drives when the number of frames requested
	for the last frame changed.
	
        Added "status" text to the trackwnd items (OK, time, rip speed)
